        <h1 id="How-close-is-too-close-for-gambling-video-parlors-and-churches"><a href="#How-close-is-too-close-for-gambling-video-parlors-and-churches" class="headerlink" title="How close is too close for gambling video parlors and churches?"></a>How close is too close for gambling video parlors and churches?</h1><p>In the state of Utah, lawmakers are considering a bill that would prohibit gambling video parlors from operating within 1,000 feet of a church. The proposal was brought about in response to a new gambling video parlor that recently opened up next door to a church. </p>
<p>The sponsor of the bill, Republican state Rep. Dixon Pitcher, said that he was motivated to propose the bill after constituents in his district complained about the new gambling video parlor. “Gambling has become an addiction for many people and it’s not just the casinos,” Pitcher said. “It’s these little places popping up all over and they’re very addictive.” </p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it’s unnecessary and will only serve to hurt business owners in the state. Video gaming company executives testified against the measure at a hearing on Tuesday, saying that it would force them to move their businesses or close them down altogether. “This will devastate if not kill our industry in Utah,” saidonite gaming executive David Mortensen. </p>
<p>The bill is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-video-parlors-How-far-is-too-far-from-churches"><a href="#Gambling-video-parlors-How-far-is-too-far-from-churches" class="headerlink" title="Gambling video parlors: How far is too far from churches?"></a>Gambling video parlors: How far is too far from churches?</h1><p>In some parts of the country, there is a debate brewing about how close gambling video parlors should be to churches. Supporters of the parlors say they provide much-needed economic development in struggling areas, while opponents argue that they are nothing more than dens of sin and temptation. So, just how far is too far from churches for these establishments?</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer to this question, as it will likely vary from place to place. In general, though, it seems that most people would agree that there should be a reasonable distance between these two types of buildings. After all, we wouldn’t want our churches to become synonymous with gambling and vice; that’s not what they’re meant for.</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s important to remember that these video parlors are often located in economically distressed areas. So, while we may not want them right next to our churches, we also shouldn’t dismiss them out of hand. They can provide much-needed jobs and revenue for local businesses and residents.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to each individual community to decide where gambling video parlors should be allowed to operate. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. However, it’s important to consider all the potential ramifications before making a decision.</p>
<h1 id="Are-gambling-video-parlors-encroaching-on-church-territory"><a href="#Are-gambling-video-parlors-encroaching-on-church-territory" class="headerlink" title="Are gambling video parlors encroaching on church territory?"></a>Are gambling video parlors encroaching on church territory?</h1><p>Churchgoers and religious leaders in several states are asking that question as video gambling continues to spread into what had traditionally been church-going neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In Ohio, for example, the president of the Cleveland Baptist Association is asking pastors to speak out against the opening of a new video gambling parlor near a suburban church. The association’s president, Rev. Johnny Hunt, said the gambling parlor is “a slap in the face to pastors and churches in the area” and called it “an encroachment on church territory.”</p>
<p>Video gambling has become increasingly common in recent years as a way to generate revenue for state and local governments. The games are typically offered in kiosks or small storefronts, and involve betting on electronic versions of popular casino games like blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>While supporters say the games are a harmless form of entertainment, opponents argue that they can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. They also say that the proliferation of video gambling is contributing to increased crime rates in some areas.</p>
<p>In Utah, for example, one small town has seen an increase in crime since a video gambling parlor opened up last year. According to police officials in Hurricane, UT, the gambling establishment has been linked to several burglaries, thefts and drug deals.</p>
<p>Church leaders say they’re not opposed to people enjoying a legal form of entertainment like video gambling, but they don’t want it taking place near places of worship.</p>
<h1 id="How-close-should-gambling-video-parlors-be-to-churches"><a href="#How-close-should-gambling-video-parlors-be-to-churches" class="headerlink" title="How close should gambling video parlors be to churches?"></a>How close should gambling video parlors be to churches?</h1><p>When it comes to the proximity of gambling video parlors and churches, there is no easy answer. Each community will have to weigh the pros and cons of having these establishments situated close to houses of worship.</p>
<p>One argument for locating gambling video parlors near churches is that it will bring more people into the area, which could lead to an increase in business for local merchants. In addition, some people might feel more comfortable gambling if there is a church in close proximity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are concerns that having gambling video parlors near churches could send the wrong message to church-goers. Some people might be tempted to gamble more than they should if these establishments are too close to places of worship. Additionally, there is a possibility that gambling addiction could become an issue for those who visit these video parlors near churches.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-appropriate-distance-for-gambling-video-parlors-from-churches"><a href="#What-is-the-appropriate-distance-for-gambling-video-parlors-from-churches" class="headerlink" title="What is the appropriate distance for gambling video parlors from churches?"></a>What is the appropriate distance for gambling video parlors from churches?</h1><p>There is no universal answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors, such as the type of gambling and the religion in question. However, we can explore some general concepts that might be helpful in making a determination.</p>
<p>First, let’s consider gaming machines, which are often found in video parlors. Gambling machines are generally considered more addictive and harmful than other forms of gambling, such as betting on horses or playing poker. As a result, they are typically not allowed near churches or other places of worship.</p>
<p>For other types of gambling, such as lotteries or sports betting, the distance can vary depending on the religion in question. Some faiths believe that all forms of gambling are sinful, while others allow certain types of wagering under specific circumstances. It is important to consult with religious leaders to get the specific guidelines for your faith.</p>
<p>In general, however, it is recommended that gambling venues be kept at least 500 feet away from churches and other places of worship. This distance provides ample separation between these two types of establishments and minimizes potential conflicts.</p>
