    </h1>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="How-close-is-too-close-for-gambling-video-parlors-and-churches"><a href="#How-close-is-too-close-for-gambling-video-parlors-and-churches" class="headerlink" title="How close is too close for gambling video parlors and churches?"></a>How close is too close for gambling video parlors and churches?</h1><p>In the state of Utah, lawmakers are considering a bill that would prohibit gambling video parlors from operating within 1,000 feet of a church. The proposal was brought about in response to a new gambling video parlor that recently opened up next door to a church. </p>
<p>The sponsor of the bill, Republican state Rep. Dixon Pitcher, said that he was motivated to propose the bill after constituents in his district complained about the new gambling video parlor. “Gambling has become an addiction for many people and it’s not just the casinos,” Pitcher said. “It’s these little places popping up all over and they’re very addictive.” </p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it’s unnecessary and will only serve to hurt business owners in the state. Video gaming company executives testified against the measure at a hearing on Tuesday, saying that it would force them to move their businesses or close them down altogether. “This will devastate if not kill our industry in Utah,” saidonite gaming executive David Mortensen. </p>
<p>The bill is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-video-parlors-How-far-is-too-far-from-churches"><a href="#Gambling-video-parlors-How-far-is-too-far-from-churches" class="headerlink" title="Gambling video parlors: How far is too far from churches?"></a>Gambling video parlors: How far is too far from churches?</h1><p>In some parts of the country, there is a debate brewing about how close gambling video parlors should be to churches. Supporters of the parlors say they provide much-needed economic development in struggling areas, while opponents argue that they are nothing more than dens of sin and temptation. So, just how far is too far from churches for these establishments?</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer to this question, as it will likely vary from place to place. In general, though, it seems that most people would agree that there should be a reasonable distance between these two types of buildings. After all, we wouldn’t want our churches to become synonymous with gambling and vice; that’s not what they’re meant for.</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s important to remember that these video parlors are often located in economically distressed areas. So, while we may not want them right next to our churches, we also shouldn’t dismiss them out of hand. They can provide much-needed jobs and revenue for local businesses and residents.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to each individual community to decide where gambling video parlors should be allowed to operate. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. However, it’s important to consider all the potential ramifications before making a decision.</p>
<h1 id="Are-gambling-video-parlors-encroaching-on-church-territory"><a href="#Are-gambling-video-parlors-encroaching-on-church-territory" class="headerlink" title="Are gambling video parlors encroaching on church territory?"></a>Are gambling video parlors encroaching on church territory?</h1><p>Churchgoers and religious leaders in several states are asking that question as video gambling continues to spread into what had traditionally been church-going neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In Ohio, for example, the president of the Cleveland Baptist Association is asking pastors to speak out against the opening of a new video gambling parlor near a suburban church. The association’s president, Rev. Johnny Hunt, said the gambling parlor is “a slap in the face to pastors and churches in the area” and called it “an encroachment on church territory.”</p>
<p>Video gambling has become increasingly common in recent years as a way to generate revenue for state and local governments. The games are typically offered in kiosks or small storefronts, and involve betting on electronic versions of popular casino games like blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>While supporters say the games are a harmless form of entertainment, opponents argue that they can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. They also say that the proliferation of video gambling is contributing to increased crime rates in some areas.</p>
<p>In Utah, for example, one small town has seen an increase in crime since a video gambling parlor opened up last year. According to police officials in Hurricane, UT, the gambling establishment has been linked to several burglaries, thefts and drug deals.</p>
<p>Church leaders say they’re not opposed to people enjoying a legal form of entertainment like video gambling, but they don’t want it taking place near places of worship.</p>
<h1 id="How-close-should-gambling-video-parlors-be-to-churches"><a href="#How-close-should-gambling-video-parlors-be-to-churches" class="headerlink" title="How close should gambling video parlors be to churches?"></a>How close should gambling video parlors be to churches?</h1><p>When it comes to the proximity of gambling video parlors and churches, there is no easy answer. Each community will have to weigh the pros and cons of having these establishments situated close to houses of worship.</p>
<p>One argument for locating gambling video parlors near churches is that it will bring more people into the area, which could lead to an increase in business for local merchants. In addition, some people might feel more comfortable gambling if there is a church in close proximity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are concerns that having gambling video parlors near churches could send the wrong message to church-goers. Some people might be tempted to gamble more than they should if these establishments are too close to places of worship. Additionally, there is a possibility that gambling addiction could become an issue for those who visit these video parlors near churches.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-appropriate-distance-for-gambling-video-parlors-from-churches"><a href="#What-is-the-appropriate-distance-for-gambling-video-parlors-from-churches" class="headerlink" title="What is the appropriate distance for gambling video parlors from churches?"></a>What is the appropriate distance for gambling video parlors from churches?</h1><p>There is no universal answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors, such as the type of gambling and the religion in question. However, we can explore some general concepts that might be helpful in making a determination.</p>
<p>First, let’s consider gaming machines, which are often found in video parlors. Gambling machines are generally considered more addictive and harmful than other forms of gambling, such as betting on horses or playing poker. As a result, they are typically not allowed near churches or other places of worship.</p>
<p>For other types of gambling, such as lotteries or sports betting, the distance can vary depending on the religion in question. Some faiths believe that all forms of gambling are sinful, while others allow certain types of wagering under specific circumstances. It is important to consult with religious leaders to get the specific guidelines for your faith.</p>
<p>In general, however, it is recommended that gambling venues be kept at least 500 feet away from churches and other places of worship. This distance provides ample separation between these two types of establishments and minimizes potential conflicts.</p>

        <h1 id="Valley-Forge-Casino-Resort-Announces-April-3rd-Opening-Date"><a href="#Valley-Forge-Casino-Resort-Announces-April-3rd-Opening-Date" class="headerlink" title="Valley Forge Casino Resort Announces April 3rd Opening Date"></a>Valley Forge Casino Resort Announces April 3rd Opening Date</h1><p>The long awaited Valley Forge Casino Resort is scheduled to open on April 3rd. The casino resort is a joint venture between the operators of Harrah’s Chester Casino &amp; Racetrack and Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, the owner of Parx Casino. The $425 million project will create over 1,000 jobs and attract an estimated 2 million visitors a year. The casino resort will feature a 140,000 square foot gaming floor with 2,500 slot machines and 125 table games. There will also be eight restaurants, a spa, and a 12-story hotel with nearly 300 rooms.</p>
<p>“We are excited to open our doors and welcome guests to Valley Forge Casino Resort,” said CEO George Russell. “This world-class destination is sure to become a premier gaming and entertainment destination in the region.”</p>
<p>The project has faced some delays and cost overruns since it was first proposed in 2012. In order to help pay for the project, the state passed legislation allowing video poker in bars and private clubs. This has led to increased competition for the casinos in Pennsylvania, which already face competition from casinos in New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
<h1 id="Valley-Forge-Casino-Resort-Announces-50-Million-Expansion"><a href="#Valley-Forge-Casino-Resort-Announces-50-Million-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="Valley Forge Casino Resort Announces $50 Million Expansion"></a>Valley Forge Casino Resort Announces $50 Million Expansion</h1><p>Valley Forge Casino Resort officials announced a $50 million expansion that is expected to create more than 350 jobs. The project, set to be completed in 2019, will include a new 125-room hotel tower, a 20,000-square-foot event center and a new parking garage.</p>
<p>“This expansion solidifies Valley Forge Casino Resort’s commitment to bring first-class entertainment and world-class hospitality to our guests,” said Tony Ricci, president and CEO of Valley Forge Casino Resort. “We are excited to offer our guests an even more immersive experience as we continue to grow and thrive as a premier destination resort.”</p>
<p>The new hotel tower will include features such as an outdoor pool with cabanas and views of the casino floor and downtown Philadelphia. The event center will accommodate up to 1,500 people for concerts, trade shows and other events.</p>
<p>“This project is another vote of confidence in the casino industry and the Commonwealth’s economy,” said Governor Tom Wolf. “It will create jobs and spur additional economic activity in the region.”</p>
<p>The expansion comes on the heels of several other recent investments by Valley Forge Casino Resort, including the opening of its new Margaritaville food venue earlier this year.</p>

<p>“We are excited to partner with the GRA to offer our guests online gaming,” said Valley Forge Casino Resort President Eric Pearson. “This will allow us to expand our reach and provide our guests with an enjoyable gaming experience from anywhere in Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>The Valley Forge Casino Resort online gaming platform is expected to go live in early 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Valley-Forge-Casino-Resort-to-Feature-World’s-Largest-Slot-Machine-Jackpot"><a href="#Valley-Forge-Casino-Resort-to-Feature-World’s-Largest-Slot-Machine-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="Valley Forge Casino Resort to Feature World’s Largest Slot Machine Jackpot"></a>Valley Forge Casino Resort to Feature World’s Largest Slot Machine Jackpot</h1><p>What would you do with $10 million?</p>
<p>If you’re like most people, the first thing that comes to mind is spending. Certainly, there are some luxurious ways to spend that much money, but there are also more practical and responsible things you could do with it, too. You could invest in property or start or expand your own business. You could save it for a rainy day or for when you retire. No matter what you choose to do with it, just know that having $10 million would be pretty great.</p>
<p>Now imagine doubling that amount. What would you do then?</p>
<p>You might think that becoming a millionaire is a pipe dream, but at Valley Forge Casino Resort, it could become a reality. On July 29th, 2018, the casino announced that it will be featuring the world’s largest slot machine jackpot. This MegaJackpot will be offering players the chance to win an incredible $10 million prize. With this kind of money on the line, there’s no telling what people might be willing to do in order to get their hands on it.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, the average American household earns just over $59,000 annually. So if you won the MegaJackpot at Valley Forge Casino Resort, you’d be taking home more than 169 times what the average person earns in a year. In fact, if you took the $10 million prize and divided it up among the 218 million households in America, each one would receive around $46 dollars. That may not seem like a lot, but it’s still something!</p>
<p>Of course, winning the MegaJackpot isn’t easy. The odds of doing so are 1 in 21 million. But that doesn’t mean that it’s impossible. If you’re feeling lucky – or if you’re just looking for an excuse to visit Valley Forge Casino Resort – be sure to give this slot machine a try. Who knows? It could be your lucky day!</p>

The casino scenes were filmed at a real casino in Prague, and some of the other major scenes were shot in locations such as Dubrovnik and Lake Garda.</p>
<p>The filmmakers were keen to keep the location secret until the premiere, but it was eventually revealed that Bond had been to Montenegro, Venice, Italy, and Prague during his latest adventure.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Royale-A-Global-Production"><a href="#Casino-Royale-A-Global-Production" class="headerlink" title="Casino Royale: A Global Production"></a>Casino Royale: A Global Production</h1><p>Casino Royale is one of the most popular – and successful – James Bond movies of all time. The film was shot on location in several different countries, making it a truly global production.</p>
<p>Principal photography began on January 30, 2006, and ended on July 28. Austria stood in for the Czech Republic, while the casino scenes were filmed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague. Other locations included Germany, Italy and Mexico.</p>
<p>The movie was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $594 million at the box office worldwide. It was also praised by critics, with many praising Craig’s performance as Bond.</p>
<p>Casino Royale has been released on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download several times over the years, and has consistently been one of the best-selling home media releases.</p>
<h1 id="The-Many-Locations-of-Casino-Royale"><a href="#The-Many-Locations-of-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="The Many Locations of Casino Royale"></a>The Many Locations of Casino Royale</h1><p>Casino Royale is one of the most popular casinos in the world. It is a luxurious and glamorous destination that offers its guests a variety of gaming options, exquisite restaurants, and spectacular entertainment. But despite its widespread appeal, Casino Royale can be found in only a few select locations around the globe.</p>
<p>The original Casino Royale was established in 1962 in Monte Carlo, Monaco. The casino has been a favorite destination of high-rollers and celebrities for years and is known for its extravagant decor and impeccable service. In addition to gaming tables and slots, Casino Royale offers its guests a wide variety of other activities, including discos, bars, restaurants, showrooms, and even a spa.</p>
<p>In 2007, an offshoot of the Monte Carlo Casino Royale was opened in Moscow, Russia. This new casino is considerably larger than its predecessor and includes a number of unique features, such as a snow room and an ice bar. It has quickly become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Moscow.</p>
<p>In 2010, another Casino Royale opened its doors in Punta del Este, Uruguay. This casino is situated on the Atlantic Oceanfront and features stunning views of the ocean as well as luxurious accommodations and amenities. It has become a popular spot for wealthy tourists looking for an upscale gambling experience.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2016, Casino Royale made its debut in Macau, China. This new casino is located inside the City of Dreams resort and boasts all the luxury and excitement that one would expect from a casino Royale location. With its prime location and world-class facilities, it is sure to be a popular destination for visitors to Macau.</p>
<h1 id="Filming-Casino-Royale-Around-the-World"><a href="#Filming-Casino-Royale-Around-the-World" class="headerlink" title="Filming Casino Royale Around the World"></a>Filming Casino Royale Around the World</h1><p>Casino Royale is one of the most popular and well known James Bond movies of all time. Released in 2006, the movie had a budget of $150 million and made over $600 million at the box office. The film was shot using locations all over the world, and we’re going to take a look at some of them.</p>
<p>The opening scene of Casino Royale is set in Madagascar. The crew filmed on location at the Andasibe-Mantadia National Park, where they were able to get footage of the beautiful surroundings. The park is home to many different types of wildlife, including lemurs, chameleons, and snakes.</p>
<p>The casino scenes were shot at the Stavern Fortress in Norway. This historic fortress was built in the 1800s and has been used as a filming location for many different movies and TV shows. It’s easy to see why it was chosen for Casino Royale – with its towering stone walls and imposing architecture, it provides an ideal setting for a James Bond movie.</p>
<p>Some other notable locations from Casino Royale include Venice, Italy (where Bond takes a romantic gondola ride), Miami, Florida (where he does battle with Le Chiffre at an epic poker game), and London, England (where M gives him his latest mission).</p>
<p>Thanks to its exotic locations and high-octane action sequences, Casino Royale is one of the most visually stunning James Bond movies ever made. If you’re a fan of 007, be sure to check it out!</p>
<h1 id="A-Global-Look-at-Casino-Royale"><a href="#A-Global-Look-at-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="A Global Look at Casino Royale"></a>A Global Look at Casino Royale</h1><p>Casino Royale is a 2006 British spy film, the twenty-first in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, and the third to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis &amp; Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, it is based on the 1953 novel of the same name by Ian Fleming.</p>
<p>The story follows Bond’s attempt to stop Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a French terrorist financier, from winning a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro. The film also stars Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, Bond’s love interest; Judi Dench as M, who assigns Bond his mission; Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter, a CIA officer who assists Bond in his mission; and Giancarlo Giannini as René Mathis, an Italian police officer who provides support.</p>
<p>Casino Royale was produced by Eon Productions for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, and was distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 14 November 2006 and was released in the United Kingdom on 17 November 2006. It became the highest-grossing James Bond film until Skyfall surpassed it in 2012.</p>
<h1 id="A-Look-Back-at-Casino-Royale"><a href="#A-Look-Back-at-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="A Look Back at Casino Royale"></a>A Look Back at Casino Royale</h1><p>With its $594 million worldwide gross, Casino Royale was a success both commercially and critically. Rotten Tomatoes has a 73% rating for the film based on reviews from 238 critics—an average rating of 6.7 out of 10. The site’s consensus reads: “Daniel Craig impresses in his debut outing as James Bond, director Martin Campbell creates an eye-popping action debut, and Eva Green makes her mark as Vesper Lynd.” On Metacritic, which uses an averaged score from mainstream critics, the film has a score of 67 out of 100 based on 40 reviews—indicating “generally favorable reviews”.</p>
<p>IGN awarded Casino Royale nine out of ten points, praising its storyline (“a clever spin on old material”), Craig’s performance (which IGN called “the best Bond since Sean Connery”), visuals that were “sumptuous” and action sequences that were “tautly edited”. While noting that some viewers might be upset over the amount of violence featured in the movie (especially during one torture scene), Slate’s Dana Stevens thought that “Director Martin Campbell deserves credit for making an old story new again” with “smart writing”, good direction and production values that gave Casino Royale an “[ feeling] of almost absurd luxury”. Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis summed up her thoughts concerning whether or not audiences would like Casino Royale: “So yes, ladies may find themselves glued to Mr. Craig’s finely cut abs…But if truth be told most everyone else will wish he had put on a shirt.”</p>
<p>In November 2006 American Film Institute nominated this movie for its Top 10 Action Films list</p>

<p>After a botched robbery attempt in 2017, Thomas Dumas is back and this time he’s planning it right. Police are taking no chances though, and are doubling up on patrols around the casino in anticipation of another attack.</p>
<p>Dumas, a career criminal with a long history of robberies, entered the casino with the intention of robbing it at gunpoint. However, his plan went wrong and he was quickly apprehended by security. This was not the first time Dumas had tried to rob a casino; in fact, he has a long history of targeting them. His previous attempts have all ended in failure, but Dumas is determined to get it right this time.</p>
<p>Police are aware of Dumas’ past crimes and are taking extra precautions to make sure that he doesn’t succeed this time around. Officers are patrolling the casino both inside and outside, and security is keeping a close eye on customers and employees. The police department has also put out a warning to other casinos in the area, telling them to be on the lookout for Dumas and his accomplices.</p>
<p>Despite the increased security, Dumas is still determined to rob the casino. He has been planning this burglary for months and has recruited several associates to help him carry out the crime. The group has been practicing how to rob the casino so that they can do it quickly and without getting caught.</p>
<p>The police are hoping that they can stop Dumas before he can carry out his plan, but they know it will be difficult given how determined he is. They are asking for the public’s help in identifying Dumas and his associates, so if you see anything suspicious please contact the police department immediately.</p>
<h1 id="Dumas-spotted-at-casino-police-unsure-if-he’s-planning-another-heist"><a href="#Dumas-spotted-at-casino-police-unsure-if-he’s-planning-another-heist" class="headerlink" title="Dumas spotted at casino; police unsure if he’s planning another heist"></a>Dumas spotted at casino; police unsure if he’s planning another heist</h1><p>Dumas, the man who pulled off a $1 million casino heist last month, was spotted at a casino again this week. Police are unsure if he is planning another heist, but they are taking no chances and are keeping a close eye on him.</p>
<p>In the past month, Dumas has managed to elude police by slipping away in the crowd or using disguises. He is believed to have accomplices who help him pull off the heists.</p>
<p>The latest casino sighting happened on Tuesday night. Dumas was seen playing blackjack at the casino. He was wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses, but police were still able to identify him.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the police department said that they are monitoring Dumas closely and will take action if they suspect that he is planning another robbery. “We are taking every precaution possible to ensure that Dumas does not succeed in his next heist,”the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Dumas became a wanted man after robbing a casino last month. He made off with $1 million in cash in what was considered to be one of the most daring casino robberies in recent history.</p>
<p>Police do not know much about Dumas, other than the fact that he is very skilled at robbing casinos. They believe that he has been planning casino robberies for some time and may have pulled off several smaller robberies before hitting the jackpot with his latest heist.</p>
<h1 id="Dumas-caught-on-CCTV-footage-inside-casino-before-the-robbery"><a href="#Dumas-caught-on-CCTV-footage-inside-casino-before-the-robbery" class="headerlink" title="Dumas caught on CCTV footage inside casino before the robbery"></a>Dumas caught on CCTV footage inside casino before the robbery</h1><p>Dumas, the man who has been identified as the suspect in the casino robbery that took place last week, was caught on CCTV footage inside the casino before the robbery.</p>
<p>In the footage, Dumas can be seen walking around the casino and interacting with other guests. Dumas is then seen leaving the casino shortly before the robbery took place.</p>
<p>This footage could potentially help police identify Dumas as the suspect in this crime.</p>
<h1 id="How-Dumas-pulled-off-the-casino-heist"><a href="#How-Dumas-pulled-off-the-casino-heist" class="headerlink" title="How Dumas pulled off the casino heist"></a>How Dumas pulled off the casino heist</h1><p>In a previous article, we took a look at how the casino heist was pulled off by Dumas. In this article, we will take a closer look at how Dumas was able to get away with the robbery.</p>
<p>Dumas used a number of different tactics to pull off the casino heist. Firstly, he ensured that he had a team of experienced professionals who were able to help him with the robbery. Secondly, he planned the robbery carefully and made sure that he had all the necessary equipment and resources in place. Finally, he made sure that he avoided detection by the police and casino security.</p>
<p>The team of professional robbers helped Dumas to carry out the robbery quickly and efficiently. They were able to get into the casino and steal the money without being detected. The plan was well-executed and there was very little chance of them being caught.</p>
<p>Dumas also made sure that he had all the necessary equipment and resources in place. This included things like disguises, tools, and weapons. He also had a large amount of cash ready to use during the robbery. This allowed him to avoid drawing attention to himself and helped him to escape quickly after stealing the money.</p>
<p>Finally, Dumas made sure that he avoided detection by the police and casino security. He timed the robbery carefully so that there was less chance of them being caught. He also used disguises and other methods to avoid being recognised by anyone at the casino. This allowed him to escape with the money undetected and ensured that his plan was successful.</p>
<h1 id="What-went-wrong-in-Dumas’-casino-heist"><a href="#What-went-wrong-in-Dumas’-casino-heist" class="headerlink" title="What went wrong in Dumas’ casino heist?"></a>What went wrong in Dumas’ casino heist?</h1><p>In literature, there are heists and then there are heists. The great majority of robberies or burglaries that take place in books or on screen tend to be small-time affairs: a group of burglars sneaking into a business to snatch a few high-value items, or a band of robbers sticking up a convenience store. But then there are the big heists, the ones that make headlines and inspire legends. These are the robberies where teams of criminals mastermind an intricate plan and pull off a multi-million dollar theft without getting caught.</p>
<p>One such legendary heist is the robbery carried out by the infamous gang of bandits led by Jean-Baptiste Dumas. In 1892, Dumas and his men targeted the casino in Monte Carlo, walking away with millions of dollars in cash and jewels. At first glance, the robbery seems to have been executed flawlessly. But upon closer examination, it becomes clear that there were several factors that led to the failure of Dumas’ heist.</p>
<p>The first reason for the unsuccessful robbery was poor planning on Dumas’ part. He and his team spent months meticulously planning every detail of the theft, but they made one fatal mistake: they did not take into account the possibility of encountering resistance from casino security. When they carried out the robbery, they were met by gunfire from security guards and were forced to retreat empty-handed.</p>
<p>A second reason for the failure of Dumas’ heist was bad luck. The team was only able to get as close to the casino as they did because one of their members was familiar with the layout of the building. Unfortunately for them, this member was killed by security during the robbery.</p>
<p>Finally, Dumas’ team was undone by their own greed. Instead of making a clean getaway with their loot, they started fights with security guards and caused a scene that drew attention to themselves. As a result, they were quickly apprehended by police and sentenced to long prison terms.</p>
<p>Despite its ultimate failure, Dumas’ casino heist is still remembered as one of the most daring robberies ever pulled off. It serves as a reminder that even the best-laid plans can go awry if you’re not careful</p>
