#  Valley Forge Casino Resort Announces April 3rd Opening Date 

The long awaited Valley Forge Casino Resort is scheduled to open on April 3rd. The casino resort is a joint venture between the operators of Harrah's Chester Casino & Racetrack and Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, the owner of Parx Casino. The $425 million project will create over 1,000 jobs and attract an estimated 2 million visitors a year. The casino resort will feature a 140,000 square foot gaming floor with 2,500 slot machines and 125 table games. There will also be eight restaurants, a spa, and a 12-story hotel with nearly 300 rooms.

"We are excited to open our doors and welcome guests to Valley Forge Casino Resort," said CEO George Russell. "This world-class destination is sure to become a premier gaming and entertainment destination in the region."

The project has faced some delays and cost overruns since it was first proposed in 2012. In order to help pay for the project, the state passed legislation allowing video poker in bars and private clubs. This has led to increased competition for the casinos in Pennsylvania, which already face competition from casinos in New Jersey and Delaware.

#  Valley Forge Casino Resort Announces $50 Million Expansion 

Valley Forge Casino Resort officials announced a $50 million expansion that is expected to create more than 350 jobs. The project, set to be completed in 2019, will include a new 125-room hotel tower, a 20,000-square-foot event center and a new parking garage.

"This expansion solidifies Valley Forge Casino Resort's commitment to bring first-class entertainment and world-class hospitality to our guests," said Tony Ricci, president and CEO of Valley Forge Casino Resort. "We are excited to offer our guests an even more immersive experience as we continue to grow and thrive as a premier destination resort."

The new hotel tower will include features such as an outdoor pool with cabanas and views of the casino floor and downtown Philadelphia. The event center will accommodate up to 1,500 people for concerts, trade shows and other events.

"This project is another vote of confidence in the casino industry and the Commonwealth's economy," said Governor Tom Wolf. "It will create jobs and spur additional economic activity in the region."

The expansion comes on the heels of several other recent investments by Valley Forge Casino Resort, including the opening of its new Margaritaville food venue earlier this year.

#  Valley Forge Casino Resort to Offer Online Gaming in the USA 

Valley Forge Casino Resort, located just outside of Philadelphia in King of Prussia, announced that it will offer online gaming in cooperation with the Gaming and Racing Association of Pennsylvania (GRA).

The casino is the first in the state to partner with the GRA to offer online gaming. Players will be able to access casino games such as poker, blackjack, and slots from their computer or mobile device.

“We are excited to partner with the GRA to offer our guests online gaming,” said Valley Forge Casino Resort President Eric Pearson. “This will allow us to expand our reach and provide our guests with an enjoyable gaming experience from anywhere in Pennsylvania.”

The Valley Forge Casino Resort online gaming platform is expected to go live in early 2019.

#  Valley Forge Casino Resort to Feature World's Largest Slot Machine Jackpot 

What would you do with $10 million?

If you're like most people, the first thing that comes to mind is spending. Certainly, there are some luxurious ways to spend that much money, but there are also more practical and responsible things you could do with it, too. You could invest in property or start or expand your own business. You could save it for a rainy day or for when you retire. No matter what you choose to do with it, just know that having $10 million would be pretty great.

Now imagine doubling that amount. What would you do then?

You might think that becoming a millionaire is a pipe dream, but at Valley Forge Casino Resort, it could become a reality. On July 29th, 2018, the casino announced that it will be featuring the world's largest slot machine jackpot. This MegaJackpot will be offering players the chance to win an incredible $10 million prize. With this kind of money on the line, there's no telling what people might be willing to do in order to get their hands on it.

To put this into perspective, the average American household earns just over $59,000 annually. So if you won the MegaJackpot at Valley Forge Casino Resort, you'd be taking home more than 169 times what the average person earns in a year. In fact, if you took the $10 million prize and divided it up among the 218 million households in America, each one would receive around $46 dollars. That may not seem like a lot, but it's still something!

Of course, winning the MegaJackpot isn't easy. The odds of doing so are 1 in 21 million. But that doesn't mean that it's impossible. If you're feeling lucky – or if you're just looking for an excuse to visit Valley Forge Casino Resort – be sure to give this slot machine a try. Who knows? It could be your lucky day!
