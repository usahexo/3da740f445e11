#  Seattle Mariners Are One of the Teams Affected by Wagering Illegalities

The Seattle Mariners were one of the teams who were named in the FBI’s investigation of illegal gambling by players and personnel across multiple sports leagues. The FBI’s sweeping investigation, dubbed “Operation Strikeout” has ensnared more than two dozen people linked to MLB, the NBA, and NFL.

According to federal prosecutors, these individuals have been involved in a conspiracy to place illegal bets on games and then conceal the proceeds. The probe has already led to several arrests, including Kansas City Royals pitcher Kelvin Herrera.

Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto released a statement acknowledging that the team had been contacted by federal investigators but insists that they have done nothing wrong.

“We are aware of the situation and have cooperated fully with MLB and federal officials,” Dipoto said. “We respect and support the responsibility of all MLB organizations to maintain a fair and safe game for our fans. Beyond that, we will have no further comment at this time.”

Dipoto’s comments are sure to raise eyebrows, as investigators typically do not contact teams unless they believe that someone within the organization is implicated in wrongdoing.

This is not the first time that the Seattle Mariners have been embroiled in controversy. In 2017, former closer David Phelps was suspended for 80 games after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug. And in 2008, outfielder Ichiro Suzuki drew criticism for admitting that he had used a banned substance during his career in Japan.

The Mariners are currently in last place in the AL West with a record of 37-52.

#  Seattle Mariners Pennsylvania Attorney General Spoke Out About Wagering Illegality 

Attorney General Josh Shapiro held a news conference Tuesday to discuss his thoughts on the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).

Shapiro, who was joined by representatives from the Pennsylvania Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association (PHBPA) and the Keystone State Gaming Association (KSGA), said that he is committed to ensuring that the Commonwealth’s gaming laws are followed.

“My office will continue to enforce our state’s gaming law, which bans sports betting, and protect Pennsylvanians from any illegal gambling activity,” Shapiro said.

The PHBPA and KSGA both voiced their support for the Attorney General, with PHBPA President Carl R. Nesbitt saying that he is “glad to see [Shapiro] taking a hard stand against illegal sports betting.”

Seattle Mariners The Seattle Mariners are an American professional baseball team based in Seattle, Washington. The Mariners are a member of the Western Division of Major League Baseball's American League. The name "Mariners" was chosen by club management in honor of the maritime history of the Pacific Northwest and Seattle's position as the chief port city for Alaska trade.

#  Seattle Mariners MLB Players Believed To Be Involved In Wagering Scandal 

According to a report from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/sports/baseball/seattle-mariners-betting-scandal.html">New York Times</a>, a group of Seattle Mariners players are being investigated for alleged involvement in a gambling scandal.

A total of nine players are implicated in the investigation, which is said to center around illegal gambling on baseball games. The players have not been officially identified, but they are reported to include some of the team's biggest stars.

The Mariners released a statement saying that they were aware of the investigation and were cooperating with MLB officials. "We take this situation seriously and we will support MLB's efforts," the statement said.

This is just the latest black eye for Major League Baseball, which has been dealing with several high-profile scandals in recent years. In 2014, Biogenesis founder Anthony Bosch was revealed to have supplied performance enhancing drugs to dozens of professional athletes, including Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun.

In 2017, Yankees pitcher Luis Severino was banned for the postseason after testing positive for a banned substance. And later that year, Boston Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale was fined and suspended for 5 games after attacking umpire crew chief Dana DeMuth physically.

It's clear that MLB has some serious work to do if it wants to restore its image as a clean and respectable sport. And while the gambling scandal involving the Mariners players may not be as serious as some of the others, it's still another black mark on baseball's record.

#  Seattle Mariners Could Face Significant Penalties for Wagering Activities 

The Seattle Mariners could be facing significant penalties from Major League Baseball (MLB) after an investigation revealed that the team may have been involved in illegal wagering activities.

According to reports, MLB has been investigating the Mariners for the past few months after receiving information that the team may have been involved in illegal gambling. The investigation is said to have focused on allegations that members of the Mariners organization had bet on games involving their own team.

While the league has not yet taken any formal action against the Mariners, it is believed that they could be facing significant sanctions, including fines and suspensions for those involved in the wagering activities.

This would not be the first time that MLB has punished a team for its involvement in gambling. In recent years, both the Atlanta Braves and Boston Red Sox were fined and penalized after officials discovered that members of their organizations had been placing bets on baseball games.

It remains to be seen what, if any, penalties the Mariners will face for their alleged wagering activities. However, it is clear that MLB is taking this issue seriously and is prepared to take action against any team found to be engaged in such activities.

#  Seattle Mariners Shut Out of Playoffs Following MLB Wagering Investigation

The Seattle Mariners were one of the most surprising teams in baseball this season, but their postseason hopes came to an end on Wednesday after MLB announced a gambling investigation involving two players.

The news broke just before the Mariners were set to take on the Oakland Athletics in an important AL West match-up, and Seattle was quickly eliminated from playoff contention.

"It's obviously a disappointing result, but we're going to have to move forward and deal with it," said Mariners manager Scott Servais. "Major League Baseball is doing their job and we'll cooperate with them."

According to reports, authorities are investigating possible links between Mariners pitchers James Paxton and Edwin Diaz and illegal gambling activities. No arrests have been made and the players have not been charged with any crimes, but the investigation is ongoing.

"This is obviously a difficult time for our organization," said Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto. "We will continue to work with Major League Baseball as they investigate this situation."

Even without knowing all of the details, it's clear that this scandal will be a major distraction for the Mariners heading into next season. The team had high expectations coming into 2018, but now they must deal with the fallout from this ugly episode.
