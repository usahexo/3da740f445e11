#  Are they related?

The cannabis plant and hemp are both in the same family of plants, but hemp is not marijuana. Hemp has a low concentration of THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis that gets people high, so it can’t be used as a drug. Hemp is mostly grown for its fibers, which can be used to make textiles, paper, and building materials.

Marijuana is also a cannabis plant, but it has a higher concentration of THC than hemp. It’s typically used as a drug because of its psychoactive effects.

# What’s the difference between them?

The main difference between hemp and marijuana is the concentration of THC. Hemp has a very low concentration of THC, so it can’t get people high. Marijuana has a higher concentration of THC, which is why it’s typically used as a drug.

Hemp is also typically grown for its fibers, while marijuana is grown for its buds and flowers. The buds and flowers of the marijuana plant are where most of the THC is found.

#  Who are they?

The Native American people are the indigenous people of North America. They are believed to have migrated over a land bridge from Siberia to Alaska more than 20,000 years ago, and then migrated down the continent. There is great diversity among the Native American people, who speak over 400 different languages. The traditional cultures of the Native American people vary greatly from one region to another.

# History

The arrival of Europeans in the 15th century had a devastating effect on Native American cultures. Millions were killed by diseases brought by the Europeans, and others were displaced or enslaved. Today, there are about 5.2 million Native Americans in the United States, comprising about 2% of the population.

# Culture

Native American cultures are based on a close relationship with nature. Many tribes are matrilineal, with descent and property passing through the mother's line. In many tribes, men and women have equal status. The arts are important in Native American cultures, and traditional music, dance, and art reflect their close relationship with nature.
