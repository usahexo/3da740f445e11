#  House earns €100,000 in first day of playing poker against Olympiacos

The house won €100,000 from Olympiacos in the first day of poker playing. The match was very close, but in the end, the house managed to win.

#  Pokerstars backing pays off for house, who earn €150,000 from Olympiacos

The Pokerstars backing of Olympiacos has paid off handsomely for the house, with the Greek club winning their first ever European football championship.

The victory over bitter rivals Barcelona in the final netted the team a cool €150,000, with Pokerstars picking up a nice slice of that pie.

Pokerstars announced their sponsorship of the club in February this year, and it is clear that they have got their money's worth.

In addition to the hefty financial windfall, the win is also likely to raise the profile of Pokerstars in Greece and further afield.

This is just the latest in a series of high-profile sporting sponsorships for Pokerstars, who are also backing teams in rugby, cricket and darts.

The House, the fictional casino in Las Vegas, has won a whopping €250,000 from Olympiacos in a Texas Hold'em poker match. The Greek Super League football club had entered the casino with high hopes of winning big but left disappointed after losing all of their chips.

The match began with a €10,000 buy-in and was played over several hours at the casino's private poker room. Olympiacos initially had the advantage, but the House soon took control and ended up winning all of the other player's chips.

Speaking after the match, a spokesperson for the casino said: "We're very happy with this victory. It's always great to beat a football team in their own game."

The House has become renowned for its success in poker matches, having previously beaten teams from Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Some have accused the club of exploiting their fans and using them as nothing more than pawns to make money, but others have argued that this is simply another example of modern day innovation and enterprise.
