Yesterday, a woman was seen hitting the jackpot on a slot machine in the Baudelaire Casino. She was ecstatic and could not believe her luck.

This is not the first time that someone has hit the jackpot on a slot machine in this casino. In fact, it is quite common for people to walk away with big payouts.

The Baudelaire Casino is well known for its high quality slots and gaming options. There are many different machines to choose from, and all of them are payout friendly.

#  Woman's Lucky Day as She Wins 88 Million from Slot Device Baudelaire!

A woman in her early 50s hit the jackpot at a casino in downtown Las Vegas yesterday, walked away with an astonishing $88 million after playing just 15 minutes on a slot machine.

The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, was understandably elated when casino staff informed her of her winnings. "I can't believe it," she said. "I've been lucky all my life, but this is something else."

Asked what she planned to do with the money, the woman said she would pay off her mortgage and charities she supports, and also take a long vacation with her family.

Slot machines are notorious for eating up money quickly, so it was something of a surprise when the woman's machine doled out such a large sum. In the old days, slot machines had mechanical levers that the player pulled to activate the reels. Nowadays they are all electronic, with various combinations of symbols resulting in payouts.

It's not clear exactly how much the woman won on each of her winning spins, but if we assume it was only $1 per spin, that would still be a cool $88 million! Not bad for less than half an hour's work.
