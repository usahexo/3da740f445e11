#  How to make a skin area gambling website 

Making a skin area gambling site is not as hard as it might seem. If you have some PHP and MySQL experience, you can have a fully functional skin gambling site up and running within a few hours. In this article, we will show you how to make a skin gambling site using the Laravel framework.

We will assume that you already have a web hosting account and a domain name. If you don't have a web hosting account yet, we recommend using [Cloudways](https://www.cloudways.com/?controller=signup&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-to-make-a-skin-gambling-site&utm_term=), which provides easy setup for Laravel applications.

First, let's create a new Laravel application. To do this, login to your Cloudways account and click on the **Create New Server** button. Select **Laravel** from the list of applications and enter the following information:

* **Application Name:** GamblingSite
* **Server Name:** GamblingSite
* **Domain:** gamblingsite.com
* **Master Credentials:** username:password@gamblingsite.com
* **Advanced Options:** leave these fields blank

Next, click on the **Launch Application** button to create your server and Apache web server. After your server has been created, go to the Applications tab and click on the GamblingSite application to open it. You will see a screen like this:

![Gambling Site](https://www.cloudwaysapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gambling-Site1.png)


Now that your server is ready, let's start building our skin gambling site. The first thing we need to do is install the Laravel framework. To do this, open your terminal and run the following command:


sudo apt-get install composer


This will install Composer, which we will use to install Laravel. Next, we need to create a new Laravel project by running the following command:



 composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel GamblingSite


This will create a new Laravel project called GamblingSite in the GamblingSite folder. Next, we need to move into the GamblingSite folder and install all of the required dependencies by running the following command:


php composer install


After Composer has finished installing all of the dependencies, we need to configure our database settings by editing the .env file in the root of our project. We need to set up our database connection details as well as our table prefix (we will be using skincasino_ as our table prefix). The .env file should look like this:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=3306 DB_DATABASE=skincasino DB_USERNAME=username DB_PASSWORD=password TABLE_PREFIX='skincasino_' 777

Next, we need to create our skin casino tables by running the following command:

php artisan migrate

This will create two tables called `skins` and `credits`. We also need to seed our database with some dummy data so that we can test our site out. To do this, run the following command:

"php artisan db:seed --class="App\\DatabaseSeeder" 
This will seed our database with three skins (leather, gold, diamond), five credits (100, 200, 300, 400, 500) for each skin, and one rule (House wins). Now let's take a look at what our final product looks like!

#  Create a casino feel with your skin gambling website 

Nowadays, there are many Authentic Skin gambling websites. This means that the skins you deposit are actually used as currency on the website. Meaning, if you deposit a skin, you can use it to bet on games just like you would with "normal" currency. In this article I will list 5 websites that offer great skin gambling experiences.

Without further ado, here are the 5 websites:
1. Csgo Lounge

Csgo lounge is probably the most well-known skin gambling website. The website has been online for a long time and offers a wide range of games to bet on. These games include but are not limited to: roulette, jackpot, coinflip and blackjack. Besides this, csgo lounge also offers betting on professional matches, making it a great place to follow your favourite teams and bet on their outcomes.

2. SkinArena

SkinArena is a website very similar to Csgo lounge in terms of game offering and betting options. However, one thing that makes SkinArena stand out is their live betting system which allows users to bet on matches as they are happening. This can create some very exciting moments when watching your favourite teams play!

3. Gocases

Gocases is a website that offers its users the ability to play casino games using CSGO skins as currency. This includes games such as blackjack, roulette and slots. Furthermore, gocases also offers betting on professional CSGO matches which can be very lucrative if done correctly!
4. Hellcase
Hellcase is another website that offers casino games using CSGO skins as currency. The website however goes beyond just casino games and offers its users the ability to gamble on different item cases opened in game (similar to opening crates in TF2). This can be a lot of fun if you're lucky enough to get some high-value items! 5. Lootbits Lootbits is a newer site compared to some of the ones already mentioned but nonetheless it's a great place for skin gambling. Lootbits offers its users the ability to gamble on different types of lotteries including raffles and wheel spins. This variety makes it a great choice for those looking for something different than just standard gambling websites

#  Skin Gambling: How to turn your website into a money-making machine 

What is skin gambling?

Put simply, skin gambling is the process of using in-game items – most commonly, weapon skins or character skins – as stakes in bets. In many cases, these skins are then traded for real-world money on third-party websites.

Skin gambling has become increasingly popular over recent years, with a number of high-profile players and casters getting involved. Most notably, Tyler "Ninja" Blevins hosted a charity stream in 2018 where he raised over $200,000 for a children's hospital, with the proceeds from the game being donated entirely to skin gambling websites. The trend shows no signs of slowing down; according to a study by Cambridge University, the value of the global skin gambling market was estimated at $7.4 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow to $23.5 billion by 2022.

Why is it so popular?

There are a number of reasons why skin gambling has become so popular. Firstly, many people see it as a way to make some easy money. Secondly, using skins as betting chips provides an added layer of excitement and excitement that regular casino games or sports betting can’t offer. Finally, the fact that many popular video games – such as CS:GO and Dota 2 – have their own dedicated skin economies means that there’s always something new to bet on.

How do I get started?

If you want to get involved in skin gambling, you first need to create an account on a reputable website. There are a number of them out there, but be sure to do your research before signing up; not all of them are trustworthy. Once you’ve registered, you can start betting on your favourite games straight away.

How can I make money from skin gambling?

The best way to make money from skin gambling is by choosing wisely which games you bet on. Some games are far more favourable than others; for instance, CS:GO has far higher odds than Dota 2 when it comes to winning big payouts. By doing your research and picking the right games to bet on, you can increase your chances of making a profit significantly.
